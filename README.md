# SwiftUIHandAndFoot
Apple iOS app that lets the user play the card game Hand and Foot with multiple computer or human players and various team configurations

Currently I am still trying to negotiate phone real estate to try and fit all the components on one screen but 
I may end up only being able to do this on an iPad.

The game requires a lot of physical room as seen in this mockup from Bill's Hand and Foot Card Game at https://northwestpages.com/HandAndFoot.html.
